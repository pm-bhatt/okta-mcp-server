"""Canonical JSON-response serialization for the Okta MCP Server.

This module provides the single boundary that converts every tool return value
into a JSON-native tree before FastMCP populates ``content[].text``.  It exists
because the Okta Python SDK returns Pydantic v2 models, ``OktaAPIResponse``
transport objects, and ``Enum`` values, none of which FastMCP can serialize
without falling back to ``repr()`` / ``str()`` (see issue #14).

Public surface
--------------
* :func:`to_jsonable` — recursive normalizer producing only JSON-native types
  (``dict | list | str | int | float | bool | None``).  Output is guaranteed
  to satisfy RFC 8259; datetimes are emitted as RFC 3339 strings via Pydantic's
  ``model_dump(mode="json")`` path.
* :func:`json_response` — innermost decorator for every ``@mcp.tool``.  Wraps
  the *entire* tool call — both running the tool body and serializing its
  return value — and, on any exception from either step, returns a
  structured error envelope built from primitives only.

Design properties
-----------------
* **Single chokepoint.**  One module, one decorator — consistent across all tools.
* **Idempotent.**  Re-serializing an already-JSON tree is a no-op, so the
  decorator is safe to add to tools that already call ``.to_dict()`` /
  ``.model_dump(...)`` during the migration window.
* **Fail-safe, by design, at the cost of MCP protocol error semantics.**
  ``@json_response`` catches *any* exception raised while running the
  wrapped tool — not only failures from :func:`to_jsonable` — and returns the
  envelope defined in :func:`_failure_envelope` as an ordinary return value.
  This is intentional: the underlying MCP SDK's own exception path
  (``mcp.server.lowlevel.server``) renders an uncaught exception as
  ``CallToolResult(isError=True, content=[TextContent(text=str(exc))])`` —
  i.e. plain text, not JSON — which is exactly the leak this module exists to
  close. The tradeoff is that such failures are reported to the caller with
  ``isError=False`` (a normal tool result whose body happens to carry
  ``"ok": false``) rather than the protocol-level ``isError=True`` signal.
  Callers that branch on ``CallToolResult.isError`` instead of inspecting the
  response body will not detect these failures as errors. Most tool bodies
  already wrap their own SDK calls in ``try/except Exception`` and never let
  an exception reach this decorator; the exceptions this catches are ones
  that escape that inner handling — e.g. attribute access on ``ctx`` that
  happens before a tool's own ``try:`` block — plus genuine
  :func:`to_jsonable` failures.

    The output is restricted to ``dict | list | str | int | float | bool | None``
    so that ``json.dumps`` cannot fail on the result.  Conversion rules, in
    priority order:

    1. JSON-native scalars are returned as-is.
    2. ``Enum`` values are unwrapped to ``.value``.
    3. Pydantic v2 models are flattened via
       ``model_dump(by_alias=True, exclude_none=True, mode="json")`` so that
       camelCase keys, datetime → RFC 3339 strings, and ``UUID`` → string
       conversions are applied at the source.
    4. Okta SDK v2 models exposing ``to_dict()`` are flattened via that method.
    5. ``OktaAPIResponse`` (and any class whose name ends with ``ApiResponse``
       and that carries a ``headers`` attribute) is dropped to ``None``; the
       transport object is never useful to MCP callers.
    6. ``dict`` / ``list`` / ``tuple`` / ``set`` / ``frozenset`` are recursed
       element-wise.
    7. Objects exposing ``__dict__`` are flattened via ``vars(obj)`` and recursed.
    8. Anything else falls through to ``str(obj)`` and is logged at DEBUG so
       unexpected types surface during development.

    Types not explicitly handled (``bytes``, ``bytearray``, ``memoryview``,
    ``decimal.Decimal``, ``pathlib.Path``, ``datetime`` at the top level,
    etc.) fall through rule 8 to ``str(obj)`` — lossy but guaranteed
